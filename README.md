### Problem Statement

We are attempting to build a model that can reliably predict who is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing a mask at all.

---

### Executive Summary

We break down the steps of our project and how we arrived at our final model and working prototype below.

#### Data

We began by looking through the data found on github.


#### Modeling

We employed a convolutional neural network on our data to create a model with .99 testing accuracy.


#### Video Detection

We are currently working on how to bring in computer vision and how to have our model actively predicting in real time.

---

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Our conclusion is that you should wear a mask. And our model thinks so too.
