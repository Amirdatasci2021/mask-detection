### Problem Statement

We are attempting to build a model that can reliably predict who is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing a mask at all.


### Executive Summary

We began by looking through the data to see what we had.


### Conclusions and Recommendations

Our conclusion is that you should wear a mask. And our model thinks so too.
